1. The socket is created using socket.socket() and specifying the socket type as socket.SOCK_STREAM will use TCP.
 (if you wanted to use UDP, you would use socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
2. Client initializes the connection while the server listens for the connection
3. We use "s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)" first arg is the layer
and the second arg is the layer we want to change. We set it to true (arg of 1). Allows port to be reused.
4. clients IP and port
5. the server will recieve an empty byte string when the connection has ended.
